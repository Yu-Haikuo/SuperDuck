# SuperDuck
## Brief Description

Super Duck is an adventure **Gameboy Advance game** in which the player is acting as a duck who needs to find her target character among the letters that move up and down within a limited time. 

In the beginning, the player uses button `L` or `R` to choose different difficulty levels. After the player confirms his/her choice, there will be a mission briefing that introduces the mission character. When the player presses `START` to enter the game, a lovely duck will appear at the top left of the window, and the other ten letters move from top to bottom. In level two letters are moving at a higher speed, and the given time is also reduced. 

The player uses arrow keys to control the movement of the duck to avoid hitting obstacles and approach the desired character. Once the duck hits the obstacles three times or the game times out, there will be a game lost page that allows the player to replay the game. After the player successfully approaches the target, the game will print a welcome message, and then directs the player to difficulty level two or the final thank you page. The player is also able to restart a new mission at any time by pressing `L` or `R` during game runtime or when the game ends.
